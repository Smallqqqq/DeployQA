If using\na different Linux distribution, please see the\ninstall instructions for your platform.MongoDB Version\u00b6This tutorial installs MongoDB 5.0 Enterprise\nEdition. To install a different version of MongoDB Enterprise,\nuse the version drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of this page to\nselect the documentation for that version.Considerations\u00b6Platform Support\u00b6MongoDB 5.0 Enterprise Edition supports the following\n64-bit Amazon Linux release on\nx86_64 architecture:Amazon Linux 2MongoDB only supports the 64-bit versions of this platform.MongoDB 5.0 Enterprise Edition on Amazon Linux also supports the\nARM64 architecture on\nselect platforms.See Supported Platforms for more information.Production Notes\u00b6Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the\nProduction Notes document which offers\nperformance considerations and configuration recommendations for\nproduction MongoDB deployments.Install MongoDB Enterprise Edition\u00b6Follow these steps to install MongoDB Enterprise Edition using the\nyum package manager. Select the tab for your version of\nAmazon Linux:Run MongoDB Enterprise Edition\u00b6ulimit ConsiderationsMost Unix-like operating systems limit the system resources that a\nprocess may use. These limits may negatively impact MongoDB operation,\nand should be adjusted. See UNIX ulimit Settings for the recommended\nsettings for your platform.NoteStarting in MongoDB 4.4, a startup error is generated if the\nulimit value for number of open files is under 64000.DirectoriesBy default, a MongoDB instance stores:its data files in /var/lib/mongoits log files in /var/log/mongodbIf you installed via the package manager, these default directories are\ncreated during the installation.If you installed manually by downloading the tarballs, you can create\nthe directories using mkdir -p <directory> or sudo mkdir -p\n<directory> depending on the user that will run MongoDB. (See your\nlinux man pages for information on mkdir and sudo.)By default, MongoDB runs using the mongod user account. If you\nchange the user that runs the MongoDB process, you must also modify\nthe permission to the /var/lib/mongo and /var/log/mongodb\ndirectories to give this user access to these directories.To specify a different log file directory and data file directory, edit\nthe systemLog.path and storage.dbPath settings in\nthe /etc/mongod.conf. Ensure that the user running MongoDB has\naccess to these directories.Procedure\u00b6Follow these steps to run MongoDB Enterprise Edition. These instructions\nassume that you are using the default settings.Init SystemTo run and manage your mongod process, you will be using\nyour operating system's built-in init system. Recent versions of\nLinux tend to use systemd (which uses the systemctl command),\nwhile older versions of Linux tend to use System V init (which uses\nthe service command).If you are unsure which init system your platform uses, run the\nfollowing command:ps --no-headers -o comm 1Then select the appropriate tab below based on the result:systemd - select the systemd (systemctl) tab below.init - select the System V Init (service) tab below.Uninstall MongoDB\u00b6To completely remove MongoDB from a system, you must remove the MongoDB\napplications themselves, the configuration files, and any directories containing\ndata and logs. The following section guides you through the necessary steps.WarningThis process will completely remove MongoDB, its configuration, and all\ndatabases. This process is not reversible, so ensure that all of your\nconfiguration and data is backed up before proceeding.1Stop MongoDB.\u00b6Stop the mongod process by issuing the following command:sudo service mongod stop2Remove Packages.\u00b6Remove any MongoDB packages that you had previously installed.sudo yum erase $(sudo rpm -qa | grep mongodb-enterprise)3Remove Data Directories.\u00b6Remove MongoDB databases and log files.sudo rm -r /var/log/mongodbsudo rm -r /var/lib/mongoAdditional Information\u00b6Localhost Binding by Default\u00b6By default, MongoDB launches with bindIp set to\n127.0.0.1, which binds to the localhost network interface. This\nmeans that the mongod can only accept connections from\nclients that are running on the same machine. Remote clients will not be\nable to connect to the mongod, and the mongod will\nnot be able to initialize a replica set unless this value is set\nto a valid network interface.This value can be configured either:in the MongoDB configuration file with bindIp, orvia the command-line argument --bind_ipWarningBefore binding to a non-localhost (e.g. publicly accessible)\nIP address, ensure you have secured your cluster from unauthorized\naccess. For a complete list of security recommendations, see\nSecurity Checklist. At minimum, consider\nenabling authentication and\nhardening network infrastructure.For more information on configuring bindIp, see\nIP Binding.MongoDB Enterprise Edition Packages\u00b6MongoDB Enterprise Edition is available from its own dedicated\nrepository, and contains the following officially-supported packages:Package NameDescriptionmongodb-enterpriseA metapackage that automatically installs the component\npackages listed below.mongodb-enterprise-databaseA metapackage that automatically installs the component\npackages listed below.Package NameDescriptionmongodb-enterprise-serverContains the mongod daemon and associated\nconfiguration and init scripts.mongodb-enterprise-mongosContains the mongos daemon.mongodb-enterprise-shellContains the mongo shell.mongodb-enterprise-cryptdContains the mongocryptd\nbinarymongodb-mongoshContains the MongoDB Shell (mongosh).mongodb-enterprise-toolsA metapackage that automatically installs the component\npackages listed below:Package NameDescriptionmongodb-database-toolsContains the following MongoDB database tools:mongodumpmongorestorebsondumpmongoimportmongoexportmongostatmongotopmongofilesmongodb-enterprise-database-tools-extraContains the following MongoDB support tools:mongoldapmongokerberosinstall_compass scriptmongodecrypt binary\u00a9 MongoDB, Inc 2008-present.

Other types of projects (JavaScript, Powershell, Python, etc.) are not supported.\n\n\nInstance Selection\u00b6\nVS 2022 supports multiple installations on the same machine.The CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE variable may be set as a cache entry containing the absolute path to a Visual Studio instance. If the value is not specified explicitly by the user or a toolchain file, CMake queries the Visual Studio Installer to locate VS instances, chooses one, and sets the variable as a cache entry to hold the value persistently. When CMake first chooses an instance, if the VS170COMNTOOLS environment variable is set and points to the Common7/Tools directory within one of the instances, that instance will be used.  Otherwise, if more than one instance is installed we do not define which one is chosen by default.\n\n\nPlatform Selection\u00b6\nThe default target platform name (architecture) is that of the host and is provided in the CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME_DEFAULT variable. The CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM variable may be set,perhaps via the cmake(1) -A option, to specify a target platform name (architecture).  For example:cmake -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A Win32 cmake -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A x64 cmake -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A ARM cmake -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A ARM64\n\n\n\nToolset Selection\u00b6\nThe v143 toolset that comes with VS 17 2022 Preview 4 is selected by default.  The CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET option may be set, perhaps via the cmake(1) -T option, to specify another toolset. For each toolset that comes with this version of Visual Studio, there are variants that are themselves compiled for 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) hosts (independent of the architecture they target). By default this generator uses the 64-bit variant on x64 hosts and the 32-bit variant otherwise. One may explicitly request use of either the 32-bit or 64-bit host tools by adding either host=x86 or host=x64 to the toolset specification.

Why is that the case?\n\nI am having so much trouble building an installation disk for it and can't figure out what files should be included in the installation. I wonder if this might have anything to do with it, but I have tried both options already.\n    \n\nWhen you build with runtime packages, the VCL and RTL are loaded from the packages and so their code doesn't have to be linked into your EXE.  So the EXE gets smaller, but the total installation gets larger since you can't use smart linking to reduce the size of the packages.\n\nAs you've already noticed, using packages causes trouble for memory leak tracing, and it also causes trouble for debuggging.  It's generally only worthwhile to use them if you're using plugins that will also need runtime packages.\n    \n\nThe answers so far miss one crucial point: Runtime packages are useful in the same way as DLLs are useful if you have a suite of applications that work together and are installed together. You could of course link the VCL and third party libraries into all of them by building them without packages, but depending on the number of applications and used libraries the size of these applications combined will be larger than the size of them built with runtime packages plus the size of those runtime packages. This will make for larger setup packages, which isn't the big issue it once was.\n\nBut using all these applications at the same time will also bring a much higher load for the system. Since every application uses its own copy of the VCL and the other libraries all these need to be loaded from disc into memory, which causes more I/O. And then there will be several copies of them in memory, each taking up space for the code. When runtime packages are used each application will have its own memory area for data, but they will all share the same copy of the packages' code in memory.\n\nFor a single self-contained application without any special needs definitely build without packages.\n    \n\nRegarding your question \"what files should be included in the installation\": you can use Dependency Walker to track down the library dependencies.\n    \n\nOne of the main reason for using run-time packages is when you need module granularity to deploy/update over a medium that does not accept well large files, like over a wire with a low bandwidth.  \n\nBecause the run-time packages remain the same until you change your Delphi version - like forever for those still on D7 ;-) - it allows to deploy new versions or new applications without the payload of the RTL/VCL.  \n\nBut like with DLLs, you have to be careful with the versioning.\n    \n\nDon't know about D2010, but in D2006 there is an option in the project menu called \"Information for ProjectName\".    \n\nThis will show you which packages are included after you compile.\n\nHowever, as Mason has stated, there is little advantage to using run time packages, and quite a few disadvantages. \n    ", "document_id": 1026}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "DB management for Heroku apps", "id": 1056, "answers": [{"answer_id": 1052, "document_id": 637, "question_id": 1056, "text": "Taps: In theory you create your database however you want locally and use taps to copy both schema and data to Heroku.", "answer_start": 357, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "I'm fairly new to both Rails and Heroku but I'm seriously thinking of using it as a platform to deploy my Ruby/Rails applications.\nI want to use all the power of Heroku, so I prefer the \"embedded\" PostgreSQL managed by Heroku instead of the addon for Amazon RDS for MySQL, but I'm not so confident without the possibility to access my data in a SQL client.\nTaps: In theory you create your database however you want locally and use taps to copy both schema and data to Heroku.\n", "document_id": 637}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Bundle native dependencies in runnable .jar with Maven", "id": 1047, "answers": [{"answer_id": 1042, "document_id": 628, "question_id": 1047, "text": "You need try to use maven-assembly-plugin in your project.", "answer_start": 364, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "I have a project managed in Maven that has some native dependencies (LWJGL).\nEverything works fine in development, but now I want to set up Maven so that it will build a runnable .jar file that I can redistribute.

But\nit is inevitable that some problems -- small or large -- will be\ndiscovered in software after it is released.  For this reason, it\nis crucial to keep aware of updates to the software.  If you have\nobtained your version of the HTTP Server directly from Apache, we\nhighly recommend you subscribe to the Apache\nHTTP Server Announcements List where you can keep informed of\nnew releases and security updates.  Similar services are available\nfrom most third-party distributors of Apache software.\nOf course, most times that a web server is compromised, it is\nnot because of problems in the HTTP Server code.  Rather, it comes\nfrom problems in add-on code, CGI scripts, or the underlying\nOperating System.  You must therefore stay aware of problems and\nupdates with all the software on your system.\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks\nAll network servers can be subject to denial of service attacks\nthat attempt to prevent responses to clients by tying up the\nresources of the server.  It is not possible to prevent such\nattacks entirely, but you can do certain things to mitigate the\nOften the most effective anti-DoS tool will be a firewall or\nother operating-system configurations.  For example, most\nfirewalls can be configured to restrict the number of simultaneous\nconnections from any individual IP address or network, thus\npreventing a range of simple attacks.  Of course this is no help\nagainst Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS).\nThere are also certain Apache HTTP Server configuration\nsettings that can help mitigate problems:\ndirective allows to limit the time a client may take to send the\nshould be lowered on sites that are subject to DoS attacks.\nSetting this to as low as a few seconds may be appropriate.\nused for several different operations, setting it to a low value\nintroduces problems with long running CGI scripts.\ndirective may be also lowered on sites that are subject to DoS\nattacks.  Some sites even turn off the keepalives completely via\nother drawbacks on performance.\nThe values of various timeout-related directives provided by\nother modules should be checked.\nshould be carefully configured to limit resource consumption\nOn operating systems that support it, make sure that you use\nto offload part of the request processing to the operating\nsystem.

See also the performance tuning\nallow you to handle more simultaneous connections, thereby\nmitigating DoS attacks.  Further, the\nuses asynchronous processing to avoid devoting a thread to each\nconnection.

In these\ncases it falls back to the behaviour of the\nThere are a number of third-party modules available\nthat can restrict certain client behaviors and thereby mitigate\nPermissions on ServerRoot Directories\nIn typical operation, Apache is started by the root user, and it\nswitches to the user defined by the User directive to serve hits. As is the\ncase with any command that root executes, you must take care that it is\nprotected from modification by non-root users. Not only must the files\nthemselves be writeable only by root, but so must the directories, and\nparents of all directories. For example, if you choose to place\nServerRoot in  /usr/local/apache then it is suggested that\nyou create that directory as root, with commands like these:\nIt is assumed that /, /usr, and\n/usr/local are only modifiable by root. When you install the\nhttpd executable, you should ensure that it is\nchown 0 /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd\nchgrp 0 /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd\nchmod 511 /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd\nYou can create an htdocs subdirectory which is modifiable by other\nusers -- since root never executes any files out of there, and shouldn't\nIf you allow non-root users to modify any files that root either\nexecutes or writes on then you open your system to root compromises.\nFor example, someone could replace the httpd binary so\nthat the next time you start it, it will execute some arbitrary code. If\nthe logs directory is writeable (by a non-root user), someone could replace\na log file with a symlink to some other system file, and then root\nmight overwrite that file with arbitrary data. If the log files\nthemselves are writeable (by a non-root user), then someone may be\nable to overwrite the log itself with bogus data.\nServer Side Includes (SSI) present a server administrator with\nseveral potential security risks.\nThe first risk is the increased load on the server. All\nSSI-enabled files have to be parsed by Apache, whether or not\nthere are any SSI directives included within the files. While this\nload increase is minor, in a shared server environment it can become\nSSI files also pose the same risks that are associated with CGI\nscripts in general. Using the exec cmd element, SSI-enabled\nfiles can execute any CGI script or program under the permissions of the\nuser and group Apache runs as, as configured in\nThere are ways to enhance the security of SSI files while still\ntaking advantage of the benefits they provide.\nTo isolate the damage a wayward SSI file can cause, a server\nadministrator can enable suexec as\ndescribed in the CGI in General section.\nEnabling SSI for files with .html or .htm\nextensions can be dangerous. This is especially true in a shared, or high\ntraffic, server environment. SSI-enabled files should have a separate\nextension, such as the conventional .shtml. This helps keep\nserver load at a minimum and allows for easier management of risk.\nAnother solution is to disable the ability to run scripts and\nprograms from SSI pages. To do this replace Includes\nwith IncludesNOEXEC in the Options directive.  Note that users may\nstill use <--#include virtual=\"...\" --> to execute CGI\nscripts if these scripts are in directories designated by a ScriptAlias directive.\nFirst of all, you always have to remember that you must trust the\nwriters of the CGI scripts/programs or your ability to spot potential\nsecurity holes in CGI, whether they were deliberate or accidental. CGI\nscripts can run essentially arbitrary commands on your system with the\npermissions of the web server user and can therefore be extremely\ndangerous if they are not carefully checked.\nAll the CGI scripts will run as the same user, so they have potential\nto conflict (accidentally or deliberately) with other scripts e.g. User\nA hates User B, so he writes a script to trash User B's CGI database. One\nprogram which can be used to allow scripts to run as different users is\nsuEXEC which is included with Apache as of\n1.2 and is called from special hooks in the Apache server code. Another\npopular way of doing this is with\nAllowing users to execute CGI scripts in any directory should only be\nYou trust your users not to write scripts which will deliberately\nor accidentally expose your system to an attack.\nYou consider security at your site to be so feeble in other areas,\nas to make one more potential hole irrelevant.\nYou have no users, and nobody ever visits your server.\nLimiting CGI to special directories gives the admin control over what\ngoes into those directories. This is inevitably more secure than non\nscript aliased CGI, but only if users with write access to the\ndirectories are trusted or the admin is willing to test each\nnew CGI script/program for potential security holes.\nMost sites choose this option over the non script aliased CGI\nOther sources of dynamic content\nEmbedded scripting options which run as part of the server itself,\nsuch as mod_php, mod_perl, mod_tcl,\nand mod_python, run under the identity of the server itself\ntherefore scripts executed by these engines potentially can access anything\nthe server user can. Some scripting engines may provide restrictions, but\nit is better to be safe and assume not.\nWhen setting up dynamic content, such as mod_php,\nmod_perl or mod_python, many security considerations\nget out of the scope of httpd itself, and you need to consult\ndocumentation from those modules. For example, PHP lets you setup Safe Mode,\nwhich is most usually disabled by default. Another example is Suhosin, a PHP addon for more\nsecurity. For more information about those, consult each project\nAt the Apache level, a module named mod_security\ncan be seen as a HTTP firewall and, provided you configure it finely enough,\ncan help you enhance your dynamic content security.\nTo run a really tight ship, you'll want to stop users from setting\nup .htaccess files which can override security features\nyou've configured. Here's one way to do it.\nIn the server configuration file, put\nThis prevents the use of .htaccess files in all\ndirectories apart from those specifically enabled.\nNote that this setting is the default since Apache 2.3.9.\nProtect Server Files by Default\nOne aspect of Apache which is occasionally misunderstood is the\nfeature of default access. That is, unless you take steps to change it,\nif the server can find its way to a file through normal URL mapping\nrules, it can serve it to clients.\nFor instance, consider the following example:\nAccessing http://localhost/~root/\nThis would allow clients to walk through the entire filesystem. To\nwork around this, add the following block to your server's\nThis will forbid default access to filesystem locations. Add\nappropriate Directory blocks to\nallow access only in those areas you wish. For example,\n<Directory \"/usr/users/*/public_html\">\nPay particular attention to the interactions of Location and Directory directives; for instance, even\nif <Directory \"/\"> denies access, a\n<Location \"/\"> directive might overturn it.\nAlso be wary of playing games with the UserDir directive; setting it to\nsomething like ./ would have the same effect, for root, as\nthe first example above. We strongly\nrecommend that you include the following line in your server\nTo keep up-to-date with what is actually going on against your server\nyou have to check the Log Files.  Even though\nthe log files only reports what has already happened, they will give you\nsome understanding of what attacks is thrown against the server and\nallow you to check if the necessary level of security is present.\ngrep -c \"/jsp/source.jsp?/jsp/ /jsp/source.jsp??\" access_log\ngrep \"client denied\" error_log | tail -n 10\nThe first example will list the number of attacks trying to exploit the\nSource.JSP Malformed Request Information Disclosure Vulnerability,\nthe second example will list the ten last denied clients, for example:\n[Thu Jul 11 17:18:39 2002] [error] [client foo.example.com] client denied\nby server configuration: /usr/local/apache/htdocs/.htpasswd\nAs you can see, the log files only report what already has happened, so\nif the client had been able to access the .htpasswd file you\nwould have seen something similar to:\nfoo.example.com - - [12/Jul/2002:01:59:13 +0200] \"GET /.htpasswd HTTP/1.1\"\nyou probably commented out the following in your server configuration\nMerging of configuration sections\nThe merging of configuration sections is complicated and sometimes\ndirective specific.

By default,\nit listens to all addresses on the machine. However, it may need to\nbe told to listen on specific ports, or only on selected\naddresses, or a combination of both. This is often combined with the\nVirtual Host feature, which determines how\nhttpd responds to different IP addresses, hostnames and\nports.\nThe Listen\ndirective tells the server to accept\nincoming requests only on the specified port(s) or\naddress-and-port combinations. If only a port number is\nspecified in the Listen\ndirective, the server listens to the given port on all interfaces.\nIf an IP address is given as well as a port, the server will listen\non the given port and interface. Multiple Listen directives may be used to\nspecify a number of addresses and ports to listen on. The\nserver will respond to requests from any of the listed\naddresses and ports.\nFor example, to make the server accept connections on both\nport 80 and port 8000, on all interfaces, use:\nListen 80\nListen 8000\n\nTo make the server accept connections on port 80 for one interface,\nand port 8000 on another, use\nListen 192.0.2.1:80\nListen 192.0.2.5:8000\n\nIPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets, as in the\nfollowing example:\nListen [2001:db8::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea]:80\n\nOverlapping Listen directives will result in a\nfatal error which will prevent the server from starting up.\n\n(48)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80\n\nSee the\ndiscussion in the wiki for further troubleshooting tips.\n\n\n\nChanging Listen configuration on restart\nWhen httpd is restarted, special consideration must be made for\nchanges to Listen directives.  During a restart, httpd keeps ports\nbound (as in the original configuration) to avoid generating\n\"Connection refused\" errors for any new attempts to connect to the\nserver. If changes are made to the set of Listen directives used\nwhich conflict with the old configuration, configuration will fail\nand the server will terminate.\nFor example, changing from configuration:\nListen 127.0.0.1:80\n\nto the following may fail, because binding to port 80 across\nall addresses conflicts with binding to port 80 on just\n127.0.0.1.\nListen 80\n\nTo have such configuration changes take effect, it is necessary\nto stop and then start the server.\n\n\nSpecial IPv6 Considerations\nA growing number of platforms implement IPv6, and\nAPR supports IPv6 on most of these platforms,\nallowing httpd to allocate IPv6 sockets, and to handle requests sent\nover IPv6.\nOne complicating factor for httpd administrators is whether or\nnot an IPv6 socket can handle both IPv4 connections and IPv6\nconnections. Handling IPv4 connections with an IPv6 socket uses\nIPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, which are allowed by default on most\nplatforms, but are disallowed by default on FreeBSD, NetBSD, and\nOpenBSD, in order to match the system-wide policy on those\nplatforms. On systems where it is disallowed by default, a\nspecial configure parameter can change this behavior\nfor httpd.\nOn the other hand, on some platforms, such as Linux and Tru64, the\nonly way to handle both IPv6 and IPv4 is to use\nmapped addresses. If you want httpd to handle IPv4 and IPv6 connections\nwith a minimum of sockets, which requires using IPv4-mapped IPv6\naddresses, specify the --enable-v4-mapped configure option.\n--enable-v4-mapped is the default on all platforms except\nFreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, so this is probably how your httpd was\nbuilt.\nIf you want httpd to handle IPv4 connections only, regardless of\nwhat your platform and APR will support, specify an IPv4 address on all\nListen directives, as in the\nfollowing examples:\nListen 0.0.0.0:80\nListen 192.0.2.1:80\n\nIf your platform supports it and you want httpd to handle IPv4 and\nIPv6 connections on separate sockets (i.e., to disable IPv4-mapped\naddresses), specify the --disable-v4-mapped configure option. --disable-v4-mapped is the\ndefault on FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.\n\n\nSpecifying the protocol with Listen\nThe optional second protocol argument of\nListen\nis not required for most\nconfigurations. If not specified, https is the default for\nport 443 and http the default for all other ports.  The\nprotocol is used to determine which module should handle a request, and\nto apply protocol specific optimizations with the\nAcceptFilter directive.\nYou only need to set the protocol if you are running on non-standard\nports.  For example, running an https site on port 8443:\nListen 192.170.2.1:8443 https\n\n\n\nHow This Works With Virtual Hosts\nThe Listen directive does not implement\nVirtual Hosts - it only tells the\nmain server what addresses and ports to listen on. If no\n<VirtualHost>\ndirectives are used, the server will behave\nin the same way for all accepted requests. However,\n<VirtualHost>\ncan be used to specify a different behavior\nfor one or more of the addresses or ports. To implement a\nVirtualHost, the server must first be told to listen to the\naddress and port to be used. Then a\n<VirtualHost> section\nshould be created for the specified address and port to set the\nbehavior of this virtual host. Note that if the\n<VirtualHost>\nis set for an address and port that the\nserver is not listening to, it cannot be accessed.\n\n\nCopyright 2021 The Apache Software Foundation.Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\nModules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap\n", "document_id": 168}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How to install a specific JDK on Mac OS X?", "id": 1568, "answers": [{"answer_id": 1557, "document_id": 1145, "question_id": 1568, "text": "Maybe you need to install the developer tools from your Mac OS X installation DVD (the dev tools are an optional install from the OS DVD).\nSee: http://developer.apple.com/java/", "answer_start": 399, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "I want to install a specific JDK (the latest for example).

Using Python on Windows\nThis document aims to give an overview of Windows-specific behaviour you should know about when using Python on Microsoft Windows.\n\nUnlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not include a system supported installation of Python. To make Python available, the CPython team has compiled Windows installers (MSI packages) with every release for many years. These installers are primarily intended to add a per-user installation of Python, with the core interpreter and library being used by a single user. The installer is also able to install for all users of a single machine, and a separate ZIP file is available for application-local distributions.\n\nAs specified in PEP 11, a Python release only supports a Windows platform while Microsoft considers the platform under extended support. This means that Python 3.10 supports Windows 8.1 and newer. If you require Windows 7 support, please install Python 3.8.\n\nThere are a number of different installers available for Windows, each with certain benefits and downsides.\n\nThe full installer contains all components and is the best option for developers using Python for any kind of project.\n\nThe Microsoft Store package is a simple installation of Python that is suitable for running scripts and packages, and using IDLE or other development environments. It requires Windows 10, but can be safely installed without corrupting other programs. It also provides many convenient commands for launching Python and its tools.\n\nThe nuget.org packages are lightweight installations intended for continuous integration systems. It can be used to build Python packages or run scripts, but is not updateable and has no user interface tools.\n\nThe embeddable package is a minimal package of Python suitable for embedding into a larger application.\n\n4.1. The full installer\n4.1.1. Installation steps\nFour Python 3.10 installers are available for download - two each for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the interpreter. The web installer is a small initial download, and it will automatically download the required components as necessary. The offline installer includes the components necessary for a default installation and only requires an internet connection for optional features. See Installing Without Downloading for other ways to avoid downloading during installation.\n\nAfter starting the installer, one of two options may be selected:\n\n../_images/win_installer.png\nIf you select \u201cInstall Now\u201d:\n\nYou will not need to be an administrator (unless a system update for the C Runtime Library is required or you install the Python Launcher for Windows for all users)\n\nPython will be installed into your user directory\n\nThe Python Launcher for Windows will be installed according to the option at the bottom of the first page\n\nThe standard library, test suite, launcher and pip will be installed\n\nIf selected, the install directory will be added to your PATH\n\nShortcuts will only be visible for the current user\n\nSelecting \u201cCustomize installation\u201d will allow you to select the features to install, the installation location and other options or post-install actions. To install debugging symbols or binaries, you will need to use this option.\n\nTo perform an all-users installation, you should select \u201cCustomize installation\u201d. In this case:\n\nYou may be required to provide administrative credentials or approval\n\nPython will be installed into the Program Files directory\n\nThe Python Launcher for Windows will be installed into the Windows directory\n\nOptional features may be selected during installation\n\nThe standard library can be pre-compiled to bytecode\n\nIf selected, the install directory will be added to the system PATH\n\nShortcuts are available for all users\n\n4.1.2. Removing the MAX_PATH Limitation\nWindows historically has limited path lengths to 260 characters. This meant that paths longer than this would not resolve and errors would result.\n\nIn the latest versions of Windows, this limitation can be expanded to approximately 32,000 characters. Your administrator will need to activate the \u201cEnable Win32 long paths\u201d group policy, or set LongPathsEnabled to 1 in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FileSystem.\n\nThis allows the open() function, the os module and most other path functionality to accept and return paths longer than 260 characters.\n\nAfter changing the above option, no further configuration is required.\n\nChanged in version 3.6: Support for long paths was enabled in Python.\n\n4.1.3. Installing Without UI\nAll of the options available in the installer UI can also be specified from the command line, allowing scripted installers to replicate an installation on many machines without user interaction. These options may also be set without suppressing the UI in order to change some of the defaults.\n\nTo completely hide the installer UI and install Python silently, pass the /quiet option. To skip past the user interaction but still display progress and errors, pass the /passive option. The /uninstall option may be passed to immediately begin removing Python - no prompt will be displayed.\n4.1.4. Installing Without Downloading\nAs some features of Python are not included in the initial installer download, selecting those features may require an internet connection. To avoid this need, all possible components may be downloaded on-demand to create a complete layout that will no longer require an internet connection regardless of the selected features. Note that this download may be bigger than required, but where a large number of installations are going to be performed it is very useful to have a locally cached copy.\n\nExecute the following command from Command Prompt to download all possible required files. Remember to substitute python-3.9.0.exe for the actual name of your installer, and to create layouts in their own directories to avoid collisions between files with the same name.\n\npython-3.9.0.exe /layout [optional target directory]\nYou may also specify the /quiet option to hide the progress display.\n\n4.1.5. Modifying an install\nOnce Python has been installed, you can add or remove features through the Programs and Features tool that is part of Windows. Select the Python entry and choose \u201cUninstall/Change\u201d to open the installer in maintenance mode.\n\n\u201cModify\u201d allows you to add or remove features by modifying the checkboxes - unchanged checkboxes will not install or remove anything. Some options cannot be changed in this mode, such as the install directory; to modify these, you will need to remove and then reinstall Python completely.\n\n\u201cRepair\u201d will verify all the files that should be installed using the current settings and replace any that have been removed or modified.\n\n\u201cUninstall\u201d will remove Python entirely, with the exception of the Python Launcher for Windows, which has its own entry in Programs and Features.\n\n4.6. Configuring Python\nTo run Python conveniently from a command prompt, you might consider changing some default environment variables in Windows. While the installer provides an option to configure the PATH and PATHEXT variables for you, this is only reliable for a single, system-wide installation. If you regularly use multiple versions of Python, consider using the Python Launcher for Windows.\n\n4.6.1. Excursus: Setting environment variables\nWindows allows environment variables to be configured permanently at both the User level and the System level, or temporarily in a command prompt.\n\nTo temporarily set environment variables, open Command Prompt and use the set command:\n\nC:\\>set PATH=C:\\Program Files\\Python 3.9;%PATH%\nC:\\>set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\My_python_lib\nC:\\>python\nThese changes will apply to any further commands executed in that console, and will be inherited by any applications started from the console.\n\nIncluding the variable name within percent signs will expand to the existing value, allowing you to add your new value at either the start or the end. Modifying PATH by adding the directory containing python.exe to the start is a common way to ensure the correct version of Python is launched.\n\nTo permanently modify the default environment variables, click Start and search for \u2018edit environment variables\u2019, or open System properties, Advanced system settings and click the Environment Variables button. In this dialog, you can add or modify User and System variables. To change System variables, you need non-restricted access to your machine (i.e. Administrator rights).\n\nNote Windows will concatenate User variables after System variables, which may cause unexpected results when modifying PATH.\nThe PYTHONPATH variable is used by all versions of Python 2 and Python 3, so you should not permanently configure this variable unless it only includes code that is compatible with all of your installed Python versions.\n\nSee also\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/help/folder-variables\nEnvironment variables in Windows NT\n\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754250.aspx\nThe SET command, for temporarily modifying environment variables\n\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755104.aspx\nThe SETX command, for permanently modifying environment variables\n\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/310519/how-to-manage-environment-variables-in-windows-xp\nHow To Manage Environment Variables in Windows XP\n\nhttps://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/faq/q1.html\nSetting Environment variables, Louis J. Farrugia\n\n4.6.2. Finding the Python executable\nChanged in version 3.5.\n\nBesides using the automatically created start menu entry for the Python interpreter, you might want to start Python in the command prompt. The installer has an option to set that up for you.\n\nOn the first page of the installer, an option labelled \u201cAdd Python to PATH\u201d may be selected to have the installer add the install location into the PATH. The location of the Scripts\\ folder is also added. This allows you to type python to run the interpreter, and pip for the package installer. Thus, you can also execute your scripts with command line options, see Command line documentation.\n\nIf you don\u2019t enable this option at install time, you can always re-run the installer, select Modify, and enable it. Alternatively, you can manually modify the PATH using the directions in Excursus: Setting environment variables. You need to set your PATH environment variable to include the directory of your Python installation, delimited by a semicolon from other entries. An example variable could look like this (assuming the first two entries already existed):\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32;C:\\WINDOWS;C:\\Program Files\\Python 3.9\n\nAll other options are passed as name=value, where the value is usually 0 to disable a feature, 1 to enable a feature, or a path.

Most\nSQL expressions can be stringified in place as a means to see the general\nform of what\u2019s being produced:\n>>> print(stmt)\nINSERT INTO user_account (name, fullname) VALUES (:name, :fullname)\n\n\nThe stringified form is created by producing a Compiled form\nof the object which includes a database-specific string SQL representation of\nthe statement; we can acquire this object directly using the\nClauseElement.compile() method:\n>>> compiled = stmt.compile()\n\nOur Insert construct is an example of a \u201cparameterized\u201d\nconstruct, illustrated previously at Sending Parameters; to\nview the name and fullname bound parameters, these are\navailable from the Compiled construct as well:\n>>> compiled.params\n{'name': 'spongebob', 'fullname': 'Spongebob Squarepants'}\n\n\n\nExecuting the Statement\u00b6\nInvoking the statement we can INSERT a row into user_table.\nThe INSERT SQL as well as the bundled parameters can be seen in the\nSQL logging:\n>>> with engine.connect() as conn:\n...     result = conn.execute(stmt)\n...     conn.commit()\nBEGIN (implicit)\nINSERT INTO user_account (name, fullname) VALUES (?, ?)\n[...] ('spongebob', 'Spongebob Squarepants')\nCOMMIT\n\n\nIn its simple form above, the INSERT statement does not return any rows, and if\nonly a single row is inserted, it will usually include the ability to return\ninformation about column-level default values that were generated during the\nINSERT of that row, most commonly an integer primary key value.  In the above\ncase the first row in a SQLite database will normally return 1 for the\nfirst integer primary key value, which we can acquire using the\nCursorResult.inserted_primary_key accessor:\n>>> result.inserted_primary_key\n(1,)\n\n\nTip\nCursorResult.inserted_primary_key returns a tuple\nbecause a primary key may contain multiple columns.  This is known as\na composite primary key.  The CursorResult.inserted_primary_key\nis intended to always contain the complete primary key of the record just\ninserted, not just a \u201ccursor.lastrowid\u201d kind of value, and is also intended\nto be populated regardless of whether or not \u201cautoincrement\u201d were used, hence\nto express a complete primary key it\u2019s a tuple.\n\n\nChanged in version 1.4.8: the tuple returned by\nCursorResult.inserted_primary_key is now a named tuple\nfulfilled by returning it as a Row object.\n\n\n\nINSERT usually generates the \u201cvalues\u201d clause automatically\u00b6\nThe example above made use of the Insert.values() method to\nexplicitly create the VALUES clause of the SQL INSERT statement.   This method\nin fact has some variants that allow for special forms such as multiple rows in\none statement and insertion of SQL expressions.   However the usual way that\nInsert is used is such that the VALUES clause is generated\nautomatically from the parameters passed to the\nConnection.execute() method; below we INSERT two more rows to\nillustrate this:\n>>> with engine.connect() as conn:\n...     result = conn.execute(\n...         insert(user_table),\n...         [\n...             {\"name\": \"sandy\", \"fullname\": \"Sandy Cheeks\"},\n...             {\"name\": \"patrick\", \"fullname\": \"Patrick Star\"}\n...         ]\n...     )\n...     conn.commit()\nBEGIN (implicit)\nINSERT INTO user_account (name, fullname) VALUES (?, ?)\n[...] (('sandy', 'Sandy Cheeks'), ('patrick', 'Patrick Star'))\nCOMMIT\n\n\nThe execution above features \u201cexecutemany\u201d form first illustrated at\nSending Multiple Parameters, however unlike when using the\ntext() construct, we didn\u2019t have to spell out any SQL.\nBy passing a dictionary or list of dictionaries to the Connection.execute()\nmethod in conjunction with the Insert construct, the\nConnection ensures that the column names which are passed\nwill be expressed in the VALUES clause of the Insert\nconstruct automatically.\n\nDeep Alchemy\nHi, welcome to the first edition of Deep Alchemy.   The person on the\nleft is known as The Alchemist, and you\u2019ll note they are not a wizard,\nas the pointy hat is not sticking upwards.   The Alchemist comes around to\ndescribe things that are generally more advanced and/or tricky and\nadditionally not usually needed, but for whatever reason they feel you\nshould know about this thing that SQLAlchemy can do.\nIn this edition, towards the goal of having some interesting data in the\naddress_table as well, below is a more advanced example illustrating\nhow the Insert.values() method may be used explicitly while at\nthe same time including for additional VALUES generated from the\nparameters.    A scalar subquery is constructed, making use of the\nselect() construct introduced in the next section, and the\nparameters used in the subquery are set up using an explicit bound\nparameter name, established using the bindparam() construct.\nThis is some slightly deeper alchemy just so that we can add related\nrows without fetching the primary key identifiers from the user_table\noperation into the application.   Most Alchemists will simply use the ORM\nwhich takes care of things like this for us.\n>>> from sqlalchemy import select, bindparam\n>>> scalar_subq = (\n...     select(user_table.c.id).\n...     where(user_table.c.name==bindparam('username')).\n...     scalar_subquery()\n... )\n\n>>> with engine.connect() as conn:\n...     result = conn.execute(\n...         insert(address_table).values(user_id=scalar_subq),\n...         [\n...             {\"username\": 'spongebob', \"email_address\": \"spongebob@sqlalchemy.org\"},\n...             {\"username\": 'sandy', \"email_address\": \"sandy@sqlalchemy.org\"},\n...             {\"username\": 'sandy', \"email_address\": \"sandy@squirrelpower.org\"},\n...         ]\n...     )\n...     conn.commit()\nBEGIN (implicit)\nINSERT INTO address (user_id, email_address) VALUES ((SELECT user_account.id\nFROM user_account\nWHERE user_account.name = ?), ?)\n[...] (('spongebob', 'spongebob@sqlalchemy.org'), ('sandy', 'sandy@sqlalchemy.org'),\n('sandy', 'sandy@squirrelpower.org'))\nCOMMIT\n\n\n\n\n\nINSERT\u2026FROM SELECT\u00b6\nThe Insert construct can compose\nan INSERT that gets rows directly from a SELECT using the Insert.from_select()\nmethod:\n>>> select_stmt = select(user_table.c.id, user_table.c.name + \"@aol.com\")\n>>> insert_stmt = insert(address_table).from_select(\n...     [\"user_id\", \"email_address\"], select_stmt\n... )\n>>> print(insert_stmt)\nINSERT INTO address (user_id, email_address)\nSELECT user_account.id, user_account.name || :name_1 AS anon_1\nFROM user_account\n\n\n\n\nINSERT\u2026RETURNING\u00b6\nThe RETURNING clause for supported backends is used\nautomatically in order to retrieve the last inserted primary key value\nas well as the values for server defaults.   However the RETURNING clause\nmay also be specified explicitly using the Insert.returning()\nmethod; in this case, the Result\nobject that\u2019s returned when the statement is executed has rows which\ncan be fetched:\n>>> insert_stmt = insert(address_table).returning(address_table.c.id, address_table.c.email_address)\n>>> print(insert_stmt)\nINSERT INTO address (id, user_id, email_address)\nVALUES (:id, :user_id, :email_address)\nRETURNING address.id, address.email_address\n\n\nIt can also be combined with Insert.from_select(),\nas in the example below that builds upon the example stated in\nINSERT\u2026FROM SELECT:\n>>> select_stmt = select(user_table.c.id, user_table.c.name + \"@aol.com\")\n>>> insert_stmt = insert(address_table).from_select(\n...     [\"user_id\", \"email_address\"], select_stmt\n... )\n>>> print(insert_stmt.returning(address_table.c.id, address_table.c.email_address))\nINSERT INTO address (user_id, email_address)\nSELECT user_account.id, user_account.name || :name_1 AS anon_1\nFROM user_account RETURNING address.id, address.email_address\n\n\n\nTip\nThe RETURNING feature is also supported by UPDATE and DELETE statements,\nwhich will be introduced later in this tutorial.\nThe RETURNING feature is generally 1 only\nsupported for statement executions that use a single set of bound\nparameters; that is, it wont work with the \u201cexecutemany\u201d form introduced\nat Sending Multiple Parameters.    Additionally, some dialects\nsuch as the Oracle dialect only allow RETURNING to return a single row\noverall, meaning it won\u2019t work with \u201cINSERT..FROM SELECT\u201d nor will it\nwork with multiple row Update or Delete\nforms.\n\n1\nThere is internal support for the\npsycopg2 dialect to INSERT many rows at once\nand also support RETURNING, which is leveraged by the SQLAlchemy\nORM.   However this feature has not been generalized to all dialects\nand is not yet part of SQLAlchemy\u2019s regular API.\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nInsert - in the SQL Expression API documentation\n\n\n\n\nSQLAlchemy 1.4 / 2.0 Tutorial\nNext Tutorial Section: Selecting Rows with Core or ORM\n\n\n\n\nPrevious:\nWorking with Data\nNext:\nSelecting Rows with Core or ORM\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2007-2021, the SQLAlchemy authors and contributors.\n\n\nflamb\u00e9! the dragon and The Alchemist image designs created and generously donated by Rotem Yaari.\n\nCreated using Sphinx 4.2.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSQLAlchemy Sponsors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite content copyright \u00a9 by SQLAlchemy authors and contributors.\nSQLAlchemy and its documentation are licensed under the MIT license.\nSQLAlchemy is a trademark of Michael Bayer.  mike(&)zzzcomputing.com\nAll rights reserved.\nWebsite generation by\nzeekofile, with\nhuge thanks to the Blogofile\nproject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "document_id": 157}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How to initiate an uninstall of a ClickOnce app, from within the app?", "id": 1263, "answers": [{"answer_id": 1255, "document_id": 834, "question_id": 1263, "text": "I'd recommend checking out this MSDN article here.

Still I managed to install everything as per the instructions on the official website.\n\nEdit: New observations:\n\nSeems like the GPU is allocating memory for the process for a second and then the core segmentation dumped error is thrown:\n\n\n\nEdit2: Changed tensorflow version\n\nI downgraded my tensorflow version from v1.8 to v1.5. The issue still remains.\n\nIs there any way address or debug this issue?\n    \n\nThis could possibly occur since you are using multiple GPUs here. Try setting cuda visible devices to just one of the GPUs. See this linkfor instructions on how to do that. In my case, this solved the problem.\n    \n\nIf you can see the nvidia-smi output, the second GPU has an ECC code of 2. This error manifests itself irrespective of a CUDA version or TF version error, and usually as a segfault, and sometimes, with the CUDA_ERROR_ECC_UNCORRECTABLE flag in the stack trace.\n\nI got to this conclusion from this post:\n\n\n  \"Uncorrectable ECC error\" usually refers to a hardware failure. ECC is\n  Error Correcting Code, a means to detect and correct errors in bits\n  stored in RAM. A stray cosmic ray can disrupt one bit stored in RAM\n  every once in a great while, but \"uncorrectable ECC error\" indicates\n  that several bits are coming out of RAM storage \"wrong\" - too many for\n  the ECC to recover the original bit values.\n  \n  This could mean that you have a bad or marginal RAM cell in your GPU\n  device memory.\n  \n  Marginal circuits of any kind may not fail 100%, but are more likely\n  to fail under the stress of heavy use - and associated rise in\n  temperature.\n\n\nA reboot usually is supposed to take away the ECC error. If not, seems like the only option is to change the hardware.\n\n\n\nSo what all I did and finally how I fixed the issue?\n\n\nI tested my code a on a separate machcine with NVIDIA 1050 Ti\nmachine and my code executed perfectly fine.\nI made the code run only on the first card for which the ECC\nvalue was normal, just to narrow down the issue. This I did\nfollowing, this post, setting the\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable.\nI then requested for restart of the Tesla-K80 server to check\nwhether a restart can fix this issue, they took a while but the\nserver was then restarted\n\nNow the issue is no more and I can run both the cards for my\ntensorflow implemntations.\n\n    \n\nIn case anyone still interested in, I happened to had the same issue, with \"Volatile Uncorr. ECC\" output. My problem was incompatible versions as shown below:\n\n\n  Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 7.1.1 but source was compiled with:\n  7.2.1.  CuDNN library major and minor version needs to match or have higher minor version in case of CuDNN 7.0 or later version. If using a\n  binary install, upgrade your CuDNN library.  If building from sources,\n  make sure the library loaded at runtime is compatible with the version\n  specified during compile configuration. Segmentation fault\n\n\nAfter I upgrade CuDNN library to 7.3.1 (which is greater than 7.2.1), segmentation fault error disappeared. To upgrade I did the following (as also documented in here).\n\n\nDownload CuDNN library from NVIDIA website\nsudo tar -xzvf [TAR_FILE]\nsudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include\nsudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64\nsudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*\n\n    \n\nI was also facing the same issue. I have a workaround for the same you can try that.\n\nI followed the following steps:\n1. Reinstall the python 3.5 or above\n2. Reinstall the Cuda and Add the Cudnn libraries to it.\n3. Reinstall Tensorflow 1.8.0 GPU version.\n    \n\nCheck that you are using the exact version of CUDA and CuDNN required by tensorflow, and also that you are using the version of driver of the graphics card that comes with this CUDA version.\n\nI once had a similar issue having a driver that was too recent. Downgrading it to the version coming with the CUDA version required by tensorflow solved the issue for me.\n    \n\nI encounter this problem recently.\n\nThe reason is multiple GPUs in docker container.\nThe solution is pretty simple, you either:\n\nset CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES in host\nrefers to https://stackoverflow.com/a/50464695/2091555\n\nor \n\nuse --ipc=host to launch the docker if you need multiple GPUs\ne.g.\n\ndocker run --runtime nvidia --ipc host \\\n  --rm -it\n  nvidia/cuda:10.0-cudnn7-runtime-ubuntu16.04:latest\n\n\n\n\nThis problem is actually pretty nasty, and segfault happens during cuInit() calls in docker container and everything works fine in the host. I will leave log here to let the search engine find this answer easier for other people.\n\n(base) root@e121c445c1eb:~# conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch\nCollecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): / Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n\n(base) root@e121c445c1eb:~# gdb python /data/corefiles/core.conda.572.1569384636\nGNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.11.1-0ubuntu1~16.5) 7.11.1\nCopyright (C) 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Furthermore, I reckon that this would not detect Visual Studios and thus unnecessarily install the VCRedist Package when it's already on a developers machine. I do not want to bug anybody with this, certainly not somebody who has already a DevStudio installed.\n\nNow another answer says I should look in the WinSxs-folder like $WINDIR\\WinSxS\\x86_Microsoft.VC80.CRT_ but this does not (yet) help me to imply SP1, or is there anything I am missing at this point ? Is there a table somewhere with the internal and \"external\" version numbers, so I could imply a certain minor version number ?\n\nI cannot believe that there is nothing provided by Microsoft for this scenario, but searching the interwebs for already far too long now brings me back to good ol' SO :)\n    \n\nFor Visual Studio C++ 2010, things got a bit easier.\n\n\n  Unlike the Visual C++ 2005 and 2008 redistributable packages, there are registry keys that can be used to detect the presence of the Visual C++ 2010 redistributable package.\n  \n  Visual C++ 2010 redistributable package detection registry values\n  \n  Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) \n  \n  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\10.0\\VC\\VCRedist\\x86] \n  Installed = 1 (REG_DWORD)\n  \n  Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64) \n  \n  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\10.0\\VC\\VCRedist\\x64] \n  Installed = 1 (REG_DWORD)\n  \n  Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (ia64) \n  \n  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\10.0\\VC\\VCRedist\\ia64] \n  Installed = 1 (REG_DWORD)\n\n\nNote: You will need to check under Wow6432Node on a 64-bit OS.

This service installs applications onto your computer. MSI files offer far more flexibility for application installation and maintenance than older scripted executable programs could ever provide.\n\nEXE files can be anything. Almost everything you run on your computer is started by an EXE file (exceptions are Windows itself, drivers). They contain executable code for a computer to run, and can do anything.\n\nMSI files are database files, used by Windows Installer. They contain information about an application which is divided into features and components, and every component may hold files, registry data, shortcuts etc. The MSI file also contains the UI that is to be used for installing, and various other data such as any prerequisites to look for, custom actions to execute, the order of the installation procedure, whether to support Administrative installations, etc. It can also contain the actual files to be installed themselves (this isn't always the case though, the files can also be in an external CAB file or just as plain uncompressed files in a location where MSI can find them).\n\nMSI files are the current recommended way of doing installations on Windows. The alternative is writing a program that performs the installation itself.\n\nMSI files are executed by an EXE file that is part of Windows, called MSIEXEC.EXE. This application reads the data in the MSI file and executes the installation.\n\nWindows Installer is pretty new, especially the newest version (3.0). Often installations that use MSI still come with an EXE (e.g. SETUP.EXE). This EXE is a so-called 'bootstrapper'. It doesn't perform the installation, it simply checks if the correct version of Windows Installer is present on the system, if not it launched the MSI Redistributable (MsiInstA.exe or MsiInstW.exe depending on the platform) and then launches MSIEXEC.EXE on the MSI file. In certain cases (especially Internet downloads), the MSI file and MSI redistributable are packed inside that EXE file, so you don't see they're there.\n\nSo installations can come in three flavours:\n\n1. A custom, third-party installation system in an EXE file.\n\n2. A Windows Installer installation in an MSI file.\n\n3. An EXE file that bootstraps an MSI file (that may be embedded inside the EXE file).\n\nMSI files can only be installations.

So now, we have managed to take care ourself of the dependencies.\n\nExcept linux related (since all our deps are already packaged on \"linux\"), we have taken the approach of managing what we named \"portable-deps\" zipfile for each platform.

Insufficient Database Privileges\n9. PHP Extensions", "answer_start": 275, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Several times our team faced WordPress keeps redirecting to wp-admin/install.php problem. There could be numerous causes. Don\u2019t need to panic, It just a simple mistake.\n\nHere, We will showcase you the most frequent problems and fixes. Are you ready? Let\u2019s get started then.\n\nThis happens due to the following issues:\n1. Missing Files\n2. Database Connection Details Problem\n3. Site URL Issue\n4. .htaccess File Issue\n5. Webserver Failure\n6. Resources Blocked by Plugin\n7. Query Limit Exceeded\n8. Insufficient Database Privileges\n9. PHP Extensions\n01 Missing Files\nIt seldom happens that after the migration some of the files missing from the WordPress root. In most cases, this happens when you copied the files from the FTP, SFTP or manually moved the site.\n\nMost of the time, wp-config.php or .htaccess files missed so please verify your WordPress root with the following directories & files. The below screenshot has taken of WordPress 5.4 version.\n\nWordpress File Structure\n02 Database Connection Details Problem\nMost of the time our team members found that this problem arises due to the mismatch of $table_prefix in wp-config.php and database tables.\n\nWordpress Table Prefix Issue\nIt is also advisable to double check the database related credentials like DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, etc.\n\n03 Site URL Issue\nGo to the database and open options table and verify the values of \u201csiteurl\u201d and \u201chome\u201d. Both value should be as per your new domain.\n\nOptions Table Value\n04 .htaccess File Issue\nSome plugins are responsible to add extra htaccess rules which may causes. So it is advisable to put the default WordPress htaccess file as follows.\n\n# BEGIN WordPress\n# The directives (lines) between `BEGIN WordPress` and `END WordPress` are\n# dynamically generated, and should only be modified via WordPress filters.\n# Any changes to the directives between these markers will be overwritten.\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^index\\.php$ - [L]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule . /index.php [L]\n</IfModule>\n\n# END WordPress\n05 Webserver Failure\nThe automatic shutdown of your machine due to power failure or software failure may put you in trouble.\n\nIn such a case, try to gracefully shutdown your WebServer (Wamp/Xammp/Mamp/Apache/Ngix) and then restart it again.\n\nWebserver Options\n06 Resources Blocked by Plugin\nIf you have installed plugins for security or optimization then, they might be the culprit. In such a case, you should deactivate the plugins from your wp-content/plugins/* directory by changing the plugins name one by one.\n\nThese plugins limiting the resources to enhance security and performance. So they eventually redirect you to the wp-admin/install.php\n\n07 Query Limit Exceeded\nMostly, This problem occurs on the live server. If you have written some custom code, then it might cause this problem. Your custom code might have crossed the maximum queries per hour limit. Therefore the server automatically locks down access to the database.\n\nIn such a case, you should normalize your code by enabling pagination, DRY (Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself), etc. Try to contact the hosting provider they suggest you the exact issue.\n\n08 Insufficient Database Privileges\nIt seldom happens that your database users might have no full privileges assigned. In this case, you should assign a full read & write permission to the database user.\n\n09 PHP Extensions\nAll required PHP extensions should be enabled. PHP extension may vary as per the PHP versions. WordPress recommended the \u201cmod_rewrite\u201d extension should be enabled. Here is the list of extensions \"bz2\", \"com_dotnet\", \"curl\", \"exif\", \"fileinfo\", \"gd2\", \"gettext\", \"gmp\", \"imap\", \"intl\", \"ldap\", \"mbstring\", \"mysqli\", \"openssl\", \"pdo_mysql\", \"pdo_sqlite\", \"soap\", \"sockets\", \"sqlite3\", \"xmlrpc\", \"xsl\", \"php_opcache\" which by default enabled with the PHP 7.3 version.\n\nAdditionally, read our guide:\n\nHow to Add Products Per Page Dropdown in WooCommerce\n\u201cSorry, your session has expired.

It's impossible to give you a more detailed answer because, well, it's a \"custom\" action.  There is no telling what code is throwing an exception.\n\nIf you want to save this machine and not have to rebuild it, you have to log the uninstall to get the name of the custom action that's failing,  use ORCA to tweak the MSI to cut out the custom action, recache the MSI and perform an uninstall.\n\nYou've now learned the hardway why to:\n\n1) Always use VM's to test your MSI during the development / test life cycle\n\n2) Avoid using custom actions whenever possible\n\n3) Never use InstallUtil custom actions.

Also check the system's event log for any clues.\n    \n\nMost MSI errors like this will probably involve custom actions, or service configuration like Chris says.\nIf this is really important to chase down you should get hold of Orca - the SDK tool used to inspect MSI files. You can see some screenshots of the tool in operation in this answer. And then inspect the Custom Action table and the end of the InstallExecuteSequence table (order by sequence number) and report what entries you find there.\nUnfortunately it seems the only way to get hold of Orca is by installing the Windows SDK. Alternatively you can download a trial version of one of the third party installer tools.\nMy guess is that there is an immediate mode custom action after InstallFinalize that is returning an error code of some sort. In short you can report all items AFTER InstallFinalize in the InstallExecuteSequence and we can probably narrow it down.\n    \n\nThat resolve the 1001 problem uninstalling windows service in Windows Server 2012 R2 I did:\n\n\nGo to  program and select Modify Service\nSelect repair Service  \nClose  the applet, select again Modify Service\nNow Select uninstall.\n\nI hope this help\n\n    ", "document_id": 1045}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Installing Python library from WHL file", "id": 1784, "answers": [{"answer_id": 1770, "document_id": 1355, "question_id": 1784, "text": "First you should open a console then cd to where you've downloaded your file like some-package.whl and use\npip install some-package.whl", "answer_start": 148, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Skill level: beginner\nI am trying to add a library in python.

It's a platform for EDI with quite a few moving parts. The back-end is an ESB written in Java SE, the front-end is a Java EE application running on GlassFish, the database is typically on an MSSQL server and RabbitMQ is used as queueing middleware. It's domain-agnostic in the sense that different message models and mappings can be deployed. Setting up a new environment tends to take quite a while, but a lot of it are mundane tasks that could easily be automated by filling in the right parameters and running scripts. T-SQL for the database, asadmin scripts on GlassFish, and the ESB configs are XML, so an XSLT transformation on a template would do the job.\n\nThis is never going to become a simple installation, but having an \"installer\" that does most of the work for you, lists prerequisite steps, presents the user with a convenient way of supplying necessary parameters, generating some scripts and putting things in place would be nice; even if only the devs ever use it, it would make life easier. Although the software is technically platform-independent, it tends to be run on Windows Server.\n\nJust making a Java application that does the above wouldn't be very difficult, but rather than reinvent the wheel (and make a probably very ugly GUI) I'd like to see if any existing solutions fit the bill.

I have also used less common packaging and deployment tools such as Computer Associates Unicenter - probably off market by now. There is also a page on Non-MSI Setup Authoring Tools.\n\nUPDATE: If you find yourself in need of an MSI tool for comparing two MSI file versions, or just to extract information from an MSI file, you might want to read this answer: How can I compare the content of two (or more) MSI files? (focused on free MSI tools).\n\nThis post provides an overview of the strong points of some of the different authoring tools as well as some snags to be aware of. For all their similarities, these tools are actually quite different. All attempts have been made to make the descriptions as objective as possible - describing real world experience with positives and negatives.\n\n\n\nRelated Deployment Topics\n\n\nBefore delving into the review of the different tools, here are a few other links with information about the MSI technology itself.\nHere is a general description of deployment tasks commonly supported in deployment tools, and a description of why deployment seems to become more and more complicated.\nA lot of people seem to think MSI is more trouble than it is worth, and sometimes that can be understandable. The benefits are real - particularly for corporate deployment, but so are some of the problems.\n\n\nHere is a description I wrote about the major corporate benefits of MSI (from serverfault.com). The article has grown too much, but is hopefully still relevant.\nIn the same article I wrote about typical real-world design flaws in MSI files (a work very much in progress - just a \"memory dump\" from experiencing \"both sides of software\": development and deployment).\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallShield\n\n\nFeature rich.\nAlways up to date with latest technologies.\n(Setup) Developer oriented.\n\n\nDifferent editions available.\nThe flagship product AdminStudio provides both setup developer oriented tools as well as repackager oriented tools.\n\nVery good release management, localization and automation features for build process automation. At least better than the competitors.\n\n\nFor complex products release management is perhaps the main selling point for InstallShield. You can deliver flavors of all kinds with ease: language versions, oem versions, viewers, application editions, etc... using release flags and similar constructs.\nRelease flags are essentially used to conditionally exclude or include certain parts of the product from each compiled setup - this is often a large part of what is asked for when making professional families of setups.\nThe release view in Installshield allows full overview of all your different setup types and editions. You see all language versions and release setups delivered for the web (one large setup file) or for redistributable media (external source files) and whatever other flavors you have delivered.\n\n\nCrucially for each release and edition you can override important settings such as product name, product version, package-, product- and upgrade code as well as many other required settings that must dynamically change based on product edition and language version.\nIn many other products this type of release and edition management can be much harder to implement. For simpler setups this type of flexibility might be less important.\n\nThe automation API for the product allows it to be easily \"remote controlled\" from build automation scripts of various types. \n\n\nThere are also command line build modules (for use on dedicated build servers).\nFull automation of the builds of a whole suite of products and editions is easily possible using regular VBScript / VBA / Javascript automation.\n\nFull localization support with string tables used to support different setup languages.\n\n\nThe base dialogs are also provided ready-made in a number of languages (costs extra).\nYou only need to localize your own setup content (features list captions, any custom dialogs or message boxes, images with text, etc...) - still a lot of work.\nYou can deliver a huge multi-lingual setup. This is not recommended in my experience for several reasons (read localization section). The worst problem is that you must localize all new and changed content in all languages before you can deliver the English version. This is almost never acceptable for marketing / sales. And there are always fixes that require you to rebuild and re-release a single language, and then you want to do so without UAT and QA for all other languages. It is better to provide separate builds for each language (easily implemented).\n\n\nGood community support: User Community Forums.\nPretty good GUI, common things are reasonably easy.\nFull-blown MSI-GUI editor.\n\n\nVery powerful. Somewhat complex.\nLimitations of the underlying MSI technology's GUI features cause some snags and annoying limitations, but this is the same for all deployment tools.\nThe root cause is that MSI GUI is implemented using tables of data inside the MSI file itself, and this causes severe limitations with regards to dialog events when compared to the full \"event model\" for proper Win32 dialogs.\n\nFull featured C-style scripting language for custom actions called \"Installscript\".\n\n\nInstallscript now compiles to native - or emulated with its own sandbox, not sure which. There is no need to install a runtime like you had to before.\nIncidentally this runtime was the source of some rather troublesome deployment problems due to runtime corruption - seemingly often DCOM related - and various incompatibilities between different runtime versions. Here are some troubleshooting links for \"legacy purposes\":\n\n\nUnable to Install InstallShield Scripting Run Time.\nSetup Is Unable To Find or Update ISScript.msi.\nFlexera Consumer Central (for end user setup issues).\n\nAlthough the runtime was a very problematic source of errors, all related problems now seem to have been resolved completely since Installshield 12 and later.\n\nNicely integrated help in GUI.\n\n\nVery important for such a difficult technology.\nOften very helpful - especially for dealing with common tasks.\n\nThe default binary file storage format allows no real source control or branching (unlike WiX which delivers this out of the box). I think there is a way to store the project in text format, but I never used it. Not sure how effective it would be.\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, by far the buggiest of all installation products.\n\n\nIn fairness most bugs relate to the special \"Installscript MSI\" project type that implements a custom dialog model for MSI setups (rather than the native, table based GUI which is suppressed).\nIn other words, the Installscript MSI project type MUST NOT be used under any circumstance. Please take this to heart, if you still use them - they are particularly hard to upgrade properly (first time deployment might be OK, but upgrades are breaking). Other projects types seem to work well.\nAfter abandoning Installscript MSI (which most people seemed to do), the tool worked quite well for me personally (not bug free though).\n\nI was not happy with the support for deployment of IIS sites and COM+ applications. I needed to go for WiX's flexibility and customizability instead of Installshield's ease of use. There was simply not enough flexibility and control available.\nSupport for Microsoft App-V virtual packages and new virtualization technologies.\n\n\nAllows a few new things compared to a normal application.\nApplication streaming - no local installation on machines - JIT.\nUse two incompatible software on the same computer.\nUpdating through the server.\nControl licensing - maximum simultaneous users or tie software to a group / user.\nPresent the application quickly and easily to users.\nMore Microsoft marketing here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWise\n\nWise is officially retired, but it has been resurrected before. Unfortunately some legal issues may have made it final this time - for all I know. That would be a shame for such a great tool. It was acquired by Altiris, and then Symantec. It now appears to be off market. I am still leaving in the summary of the good Wise features:\n\n\nFast and easy and quite feature rich.\n\n\nVery good ease of use overall, excellent feature set.\nLacking in some (very) advanced features such as IIS, advanced release management, etc...\n\nAdministrator / Repackager oriented.\n\n\nLess code focused than Installshield.\nUniquely capable and flexible graphical scripting editor.\nWell designed setup configuration GUI.\n\nAlso excellent for small development teams looking for a quick and relatively easy way to get their application deployed.\nSometimes lagging slightly with latest technologies (compared to Installshield), but comparatively \"bug free\".\nIntuitive GUI, common things are (very) easy.\nVery nice handling of installation sequence configuration and custom actions in a script style editor. More GUI scripting, less coding.\nRock solid, very few significant bugs.\nHelp resources and community support not on par with InstallShield, but still good.\nMy tool of choice for debugging and prototyping (fast, stable, easy to use, great diff features).\nAnd with regards to the diff features (allowing binary comparison of two MSI files).\n\n\nNo other tool I have tried has come close to Wise for binary diffs of different MSI files.\nThe ease-of-use and clarity of the diff viewer was no less than fantastic.\nFor corporate packaging such diff-features can be a very critical part of the job as you have hundreds or even thousands of different software packages to manage in many different versions.\n\nOn a subjective note: my favorite packaging tool. Very reliable.\n\n\nIt is a real shame that the tool is no longer available.\nWe can always hope for a \"reincarnation\" (I have seen GUI snippets that look like Wise in some other tools).\n\n\n\n\n\nWiX (quick-start tips)\n\n\nThe big plus is the text source files. There is no need to store the source as a binary where it is almost impossible to track changes and do proper version control.\n\n\nProper text sources make all the difference for development teams in terms of branching, versioning and merging. It is a quantum leap (in my opinion particularly for in-house development in large corporations - where process is complex, turnaround is quick and there are many developers).\nThe need for and use of text source files was central to the creation of the WiX toolkit. Here is a quick and incomplete \"WiX history\" with more details. Recommended read to grasp the foundation and rationale for WiX.\nSome deployment tools that store the installer as binaries could end up in situations where the binary source would exhibit mysterious problems that could never be tracked down properly.\n\n\nThis happened particularly after tool updates which also updated the format in the source (for whatever reason).\nThe upgrades would often affect dozens of tables and hundreds of records making it an impossible task to track down the real problem effectively.\nSymptoms included things such as the sudden onset of slow builds, sudden slow installation speed, unexplainable compilation errors, even total file corruption etc... \nWith WiX you have full transparency and \"leanness\" for your source. It is just cleaner and more reliable when done right and automatic updates of the source is possible, but won't cause cascading changes through dozens of MSI tables. Combined with source control changes are easily tracked and (hopefully) understood - no mysterious, undocumented stuff added.\nWith all that said it must be noted that upgrading from WiX 3 to WiX 4 source files appears to not be trivial. Let's hope this is a one-time situation. I am not sure why this has happened to be honest, and I don't have up to date information about it.\nPerhaps check for real news straight from Rob Mensching's blog: http://robmensching.com/blog/ and Bob Arnson's blog https://www.joyofsetup.com/. Straight from the horse's mouth as the Internet makes possible - it is a wonderful world at times ;-). Rumor has it they are doing \"turtles all the way down\".\n\n\nRock solid, very few significant bugs.\n\n\nFor those who have struggled with long-standing, intermittent, unexplainable bugs in other tools, this is a godsend. {War stories removed}.\nAnd even better: problems actually seem to get fixed in WiX, sometimes with community help - as is appropriate for an open source toolkit. Most of the time it seems the core team takes care of it though.\n\nVery feature rich, but somewhat hard to use at times.\n\n\nTakes time to get used to, and even when you are used to it things can be \"fiddly\" to get right (particularly if you don't use the included helper tools properly).\nIt helps to use the dark.exe decompiler tool to decompile existing MSI files to WiX XML. This allows you to study the WiX source without knowing too much about it beforehand.\nExceptional customizability for complex things such as IIS, COM+, SQL Server, permissioning, firewall rules, etc... \n\"Everything\" is possible, but somewhat involved at times.\nWiX effectively \"extends Windows Installer\" with new and much needed functionality. This is a massive benefit for everyone who previously had to \"roll their own\" solutions - often for things that seemed trivial (but was still very error prone).\nThe power of these extensions can not be overstated. You can get rid of a lot of self-written, complex custom actions in favor of tested solutions. With proper rollback support! (a much neglected feature in vendor setups - in my experience almost all of them - causing unclean system state after aborted setups).\nI have personal experience writing a C++ dll with custom actions for common tasks with proper rollback support, and the amount of work was staggering - especially the QA of the actual rollback feature.\n\nA remarkable lack of GUI tools and very few good samples available - particularly for WiX 4.\n\n\nThings seem to be improving, perhaps try this short summary.\nAn interesting project might be IsWiX. It is worth checking out.\n\n\nWiX tutorials: https://github.com/iswix-llc/iswix-tutorials\nQuick Youtube demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnV_OU6fk8c\n\nI am outdated here, please help update this if you got more up to date information.\n\nFull integration in Visual Studio, with IntelliSense.\n\n\nApparently there will be some restrictions as to what versions of Visual Studio will be supported by WiX 4.\nI don't have the details yet, but you will need a recent version of Visual Studio. I think there are good blog entries from Rob and Bob about this.\n\nIt's free (!). Every developer can build the setup. Someone must own it though(!). Really ;-).\nIt is Open Source too.\n\n\nThe \"community\": https://github.com/wixtoolset. And the open issues: https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/issues\nThe toolkit download includes DTF too (Deployment Tools Foundation). .NET classes for dealing with all things MSI files with automation. See a sample inline here. Extremely useful and good quality. NO COM interop to deal with. See this serverfault.com post. And Chris Painter's blog.\n\nHow do you get started? (direct link to an answer that has been well-received - to my surprise).\n\n\nFor sample based tinkerers try this The Code Project article for a quick-start in how to create MSI files with WiX (WiX 3). It is really simple (if you know MSI it is self-evident).\nYou can also read this WiX Stack\u00a0Overflow article for further quick-start tips.\nNEW &amp; RECOMMENDED: A stackoverflow answer showing the current minimal changes needed to compile a working MSI file when creating a new WiX project in Visual Studio: WiX installer msi not installing the Winform app created with Visual Studio 2017.\nAnd you can use WiX's dark.exe (MSI decompiler) to decompile an existing MSI file to proper WiX XML format and then study how it fits together. Very useful and educational - especially for advanced features.\n\nCurrent and future versions.\n\n\nVersion 3.1 is stable and out (Released May 2017). Rock solid.\nVersion 4 has been eight years in development at this point (August 2017).\n\n\nIt is not clear when it will be available for stable release.\nIt will apparently be a very major update that requires substantial rework to existing WiX files to use successfully.\nI can not provide any details on what the major differences are at this point.\nThe stability and reliability of version 3 has no doubt been preserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Installer\n\n\nI have not used this for real development.\nVery easy to use, nice GUI.\nUPDATE: \n\n\nExtremely good integrated logging in the tool itself during development test installation. Very impressive.\nAlso available for corporate repackaging in its \"Architect edition\".\nFeature rich. Compiles all kinds of setups and supports all new technologies (App-X, App-V, etc...)\nSupport for App-V seems very extensive.\nCan import a number of other tools' source files (Installshield, Inno, Wix, Wise, NSIS, Visual Studio, Desktop Bridge, etc...). Not tested extensively by me.\n\nStores projects in a proprietary text format as far as I can see.\nSeems solid, and crucially hides some MSI complexity via a good GUI that shows intuitive check boxes and options rather than SDK style flags and properties. This is a good thing, and missing completely from WiX at this point.\nLooks like it might be good for prototyping and testing, very strong GUI and automagic for commonly used features.\nI miss InstallShield's Release view with its release flags and build automation settings as well as other release management features (could be improved by now).\nOverall a solid tool that looks best suited for developers looking for an easy way to get their applications deployed. Similar to Wise in that regard.\nToo little practical experience to write much more. Try it out.\n\n\n\n\nOther Tools\n\n\nOrca is the free Windows SDK tool which allows binary MSI files to be opened, edited and to a certain degree compared. It also allows other operations such as generating transform files for modifying the MSI files and some other technical operations. A basic tool that I always like to have installed and available. There is a more extensive Orca paragraph here discussing its use (look towards the bottom). You normally have to install the Windows SDK to get hold of Orca (just install the latest version and search for the tool).\nA free tool called \"Super Orca\" has been recommended to me, as has \"InstEd\". I have used them only briefly, but they look OK, and they are easier to get hold of than Orca (no Windows SDK to download).\nAnd there are also many other tools. Here is a list of tools from http://www.installsite.org with an indication whether the tool is still actively maintained or not: http://www.installsite.org/pages/en/msi/authoring.htm (with thanks to Phil Wilson for the link - I couldn't resurrect his answer).\nI suppose I can also include a link to wikipedia's list of installation software.\n\n\n\n\nTool Recommendations?\n\nIt is not my place to make direct tool recommendations. But I guess I can make some \"observations\" and provide some further links for decision making.\n\nFor any serious in-house development team I would suggest WiX. Where other tools have ease of use (which is very important, and sometimes the only thing that is important), WiX excels in its flexibility, extensibility, stability and the use of XML text source files - with the penalty of being somewhat involved to deal with. And due to its free license every developer can view and compile the source and changes are easily tracked, reverted or approved. Managing a process with developers all updating a single WiX source still has its challenges though (no different from regular development work - nothing is easy).\n\nFor corporate repackaging (which admittedly is a little beyond the developer focus of stackoverflow.com) I guess the major options at the moment are Flexera AdminStudio and Advanced Installer Architect. There are also other products available, and as always installsite.org has details: Tools: Repackaging &amp; Corporate Deployment.\n\nFor small development teams looking for a quick and easy way to deploy their applications, I guess Installshield and Advanced Installer are the most common \"GUI based\" tools. They provide a lot of features, and your will be able to deliver a setup quickly. As already stated, sometimes this is the only thing that is important. Very often in fact. It is, however, possible to deliver a great installer using WiX instead - but a lot more knowledge is required. There is a learning curve, and there are some severe limitations - particularly with regards to GUI at the moment - but the base technology is very solid and free. And importantly there are  many other tools (list from http://www.installsite.org) as well that may be more appropriate for your task - particularly if it is a simple application that just needs basic deployment features. It is \"unfair\" that I haven't provided more information about these  tools that are quite capable, but less commonly used or established.\n\nI should make it clear that I recommend WiX for corporate teams delivering in-house applications because they can use the flexibility provided by WiX and they will also have the available expertise and technical skill to deal with the complexity of WiX. And they can train new guys when needed. A very important issue. WiX is not trivial to learn unless you already have a lot of Windows Installer knowledge - then it is a piece of cake, but still takes time because it is so flexible and for lack of a better word: \"fiddly\" - it is like real development, you got real control but need to be precise. Once set up a WiX source can be a dream to deal with - you know what is going on.\n\nTo summarize: if you are a small (or large) third party vendor looking for a good way to get your application delivered quickly to your customers you are probably better off with a commercial tool aiming to provide ease of use and a quick solution to implement limited amounts of changes. For IIS, in particular, commercial tools have failed to provide the flexibility needed for me in the past. And in-house development teams should at least try WiX out.\n\nFinally a word of caution: Advanced Installer, InstallShield and Wise generally allow packaging of software for virtualization. I am not aware of any features in WiX for this as of now. Please add comments or just edit this post if you have information here.\n\n\n\nTop Practical Tip:\n\nI generally use other tools for prototyping and WiX for implementation if I have a choice. You can use WiX's dark.exe (MSI decompiler) to decompile an existing MSI file. Sometimes I implement something in Wise or InstallShield, compile an MSI and decompile it to WiX format. Then I lift the WiX markup and dump into my main WiX file. Works great and usually very fast. This in combination with the heat.exe tool for automatic component creation enabled me to package a huge IIS web site in less than 10 minutes after some practice runs. Afterwards I have the full customizability provided by WiX, with the ease of use of the other tools.\n\nCleaning up the decompiled source is no picnic, but it is not rocket science either. Some MSI knowledge is needed and you will be \"fiddling\" for a while. Be aware that downloading trial versions of commercial tools to generate and decompile an MSI file is not recommended. The resulting MSI files are generally \"watermarked\" with features that are hard to remove.\n\n\n\nSome Links:\n\n\nHow to create windows installer\nShortlist of deployment tools\nOlder content\n\n    \n\nYou shall check out the freeware Inno Setup: for the long time I'm using it, it never disapointed me!\n    \n\n\n  How good is WiX at non-.NET stuff?\n\n\nWiX has support for all Windows Installer features by design. Windows installer predates .NET.\n\nPersonally I prefer WiX over InstallShield because\n\n\nthe XML text format allows review of\ncommits, merging of changes between\nbranches\nbuild automation should include setup\ngeneration, which is easy with WiX\nwixlib files with component group\ndefinitions allow for modular setup\ndevelopment. No need to worry about\nthe dependencies of the dependencies,\netc.\nno licensing or deployment headaches,\nwe simply include the WiX toolset in\na /tools folder of our projects in\nSVN\n\n\nWhen we used InstallShield, these were all pain points. WiX does have a very steep learning curve though.\n    \n\nI haven't used InstallShield in a few years. At my last job we moved away from it to NSIS mainly because its binary format made version control difficult, and because a few times the source file simply became corrupted, with no hope for recovery. That might have been related to SourceSafe of course!\n\nOn top of that though, it was needlessly complicated. Don't get me wrong - we were doing some reasonably complicated installers, with lots of conditional paths, merge modules, and sophisticated UIs, but even for that it was far, far too complex.\n\nNSIS has a great plugin system, and you can program it imperatively using the LogicLib plugin, have automatic uninstall files generated, and lots of other things besides.\n    \n\nI inherited a handful of InstallShield (v12) projects. The files are all text/XML and thus there are no version control issues. We have a build machine that uses their command line tools, which works well. What I don't like is (a) the cost per developer seat and (b) bugs.\n\nInno Setup is very capable/flexible and there are generally multiple ways to accomplish a goal, which led to a steep learning curve. We are several versions behind their latest version (due to their upgrade cost structure). Because our products run on Widows, if we have to switch I might first research Microsoft's installer solution that comes with a MSDN subscription.\n    ", "document_id": 1105}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Tomee 9 with jax-rs always returns error 404 not found", "id": 1347, "answers": [{"answer_id": 1337, "document_id": 916, "question_id": 1347, "text": "You are using a version of swagger, which does not support the jakarta namespace.

For web application development I use this in combination with paster (http://pythonpaste.org/) for the deployment process\n    \n\nOther than easy_install?\n\nFor our Linux servers, we use easy_install and yum.\n\nFor our Windows development laptops, we use easy_install and a few MSI's for some projects.\n\nMost of the Python libraries we use are source-only, so we can use the same distribution on all boxes.  If we could have a network shared device, we'd put them all there.  Sadly, our infrastructure is kind of scattered, so we have to either move .TAR files around or redo the installs to rebuild the environments.\n\nIn a few cases (e.g., PIL), we have to recompile and check the version numbers.\n    \n\nYou will want easy_setup to get the eggs (roughly what Maven calls an artifact).\n\nFor setting up your environment, have a look at working-env.py\n\nPython is not compiled but you can put all files for a project in an egg. This is done with setuptools\n\nFor CI, check this answer.\n    \n\nWe would be remiss not to also mention Paver, which was created by Kevin Dangoor of TurboGears fame.  The project is still in alpha, but it appears very promising.  A snippet from the project page:\n\n\n  Paver is a Python-based build/distribution/deployment scripting tool along the lines of Make or Rake. What makes Paver unique is its integration with commonly used Python libraries. Common tasks that were easy before remain easy. More importantly, dealing with your applications specific needs and requirements is now much easier.\n\n    \n\nI do exactly this with a combination of setuptools and Hudson. I know Hudson is a java app, but it can run Python stuff just fine.\n    \n\nYou might want to check our Devenv. It allows you to standardize the build environments for development, QA and UAT. It's free as in \"free beer\".\n\nHTH\n    ", "document_id": 1032}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How do I get WiX installer to request administrative privileges?", "id": 1747, "answers": [{"answer_id": 1734, "document_id": 1319, "question_id": 1747, "text": "You may need the following command:\nInstallPrivileges=\"elevated\" AdminImage=\"yes\" InstallScope=\"perMachine\"", "answer_start": 714, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "We have a program we have developed in house.

Usually in regards to installation customization, upgrade paths, etc. What are some good alternatives for software deployment? In particular I'm interested in features, .NET integration or scripting capabilities, easy of use, and price.\n    \n\n\nWindows Installer XML (Wix)\nNullSoft Installer\n\n    \n\nNullSoft Installer is my all time favorite.\nIt creates the smallest setup executables possible.\nAlso Uninstall is super clean. It will remove all the traces and leave PC in the same shape as before installation.\n    \n\nNullSoft Installer (NSIS) is good, but building the scripts is painful - even with HM NIS Edit. You basically have to learn a whole different language to be able to work with their scripts. Example:\n\nPlug-ins are necessary to do a lot of things as well, like check the .NET framework version or see if the application you are updating is already running. \n\nAside from that though, once you get everything configured it is fast and works well. There's really not a better installer (for free) out there.\n    \n\nNullsoft Installer (NSIS) is probably the best free installation system.\n\nAs there is no good IDE for NSIS I decided to create my own - I developed really nice Visual Studio extension for NSIS with many features (syntax highlighting, intellisense, navigation bars, compilation, error list etc etc).\n\nIt is called Visual &amp; Installer and you can check it on www.visual-installer.com (sorry for self promo :)\n    ", "document_id": 997}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "how to force rpm to install files in a single directory is it possible", "id": 1379, "answers": [{"answer_id": 1368, "document_id": 949, "question_id": 1379, "text": "you can use the --relocate to change 1 directory of the install process\n\nrpm -i --relocate /usr/sbin=/some/other/path/sbin packagename.rpm\n\n\nor use --prefix for the whole installation process\n\nrpm  -i --prefix=/some/other/path/ packagename.rpm", "answer_start": 982, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "\n\n                    \n\n            \n\n        \n\n            \n\n                \n\n                    \n\n                        Closed.

They remain available for archival purposes. Please visit https://docs.oracle.com/javase for the most up-to-date documentation.\n\nThis page shows you, step by step, how to convert a simple Java application to a version you can distribute on a Mac. To follow along, download the ButtonDemo (.zip) example from the Java Tutorial. This example was created using NetBeans which uses the Ant utility. You can run all necessary tools and make all necessary edits from the command line, without launching NetBeans. The Ant tool is required.\n\nYou have created a Java application and want to bundle it for deployment. This requires the following steps:\n\nCreate a JAR File\nBundle the JAR File into an App Package\nBundle the JRE with the App Package\nSign the App\nSubmitting an App to the Mac App Store\nCreate a JAR File\nThis step creates the ButtonDemo.jar file.\n\nExecute ant jar in the high-level project directory to create the dist/ButtonDemo.jar file. This jar file is used to create the .app package.\n\nBundle the JAR File into an App Package\nTo create the ButtonDemo.app package, use the appbundler tool. The appbundler is not shipped with the 7u6 version of the Oracle JDK for the Mac. You can download it from the Java Application Bundler project on java.net. There is also AppBundler Documentation available.\n\nAs of this writing, the most recent version is appbundler-1.0.jar, which is used by this document. Download the latest version available and substitute the file name accordingly.\n\nInstall the appbundler-1.0.jar file. In this case, create a lib directory in the high-level project directory and add the appbundler-1.0.jar file.\nModify the build.xml file in the high-level project directory as follows. (The added code is shown in bold.)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<project name=\"ButtonDemo\" default=\"default\" basedir=\".\">        \n    <import file=\"nbproject/build-impl.xml\"/>\n\n    <taskdef name=\"bundleapp\"\n             classname=\"com.oracle.appbundler.AppBundlerTask\"   \n             classpath=\"lib/appbundler-1.0.jar\" />\n\n    <target name=\"bundle-buttonDemo\">\n        <bundleapp outputdirectory=\"dist\"\n            name=\"ButtonDemo\"\n            displayname=\"Button Demo\"\n            identifier=\"components.ButtonDemo\"\n            mainclassname=\"components.ButtonDemo\">\n            <classpath file=\"dist/ButtonDemo.jar\" />\n        </bundleapp>\n    </target>\n\n</project>\nInvoke the appbundler by typing ant bundle-buttonDemo from the high-level project directory. This creates the ButtonDemo.app package in the dist directory.\nYou should now be able to launch the application by double clicking ButtonDemo.app in the Finder, or by typing open ButtonDemo.app at the command line.\nBundle the JRE with the App Package\nIn order to distribute a Java application, you want to avoid dependencies on third party software. Your app package should include the Java Runtime Environment, or JRE. In fact, the Apple Store requires the use of an embedded JRE as a prerequisite for Mac App Store distribution. The runtime sub-element of the <bundleapp> task specifies the root of the JRE that will be included in the app package.\n\nIn this example, the location of the JRE is defined using the JAVA_HOME environment variable. However, you might choose to bundle a JRE that is not the same as the one you are using for development. For example you might be developing on 7u6, but you need to bundle the app with 7u4. You will define runtime accordingly.\n\nSince this example defines the runtime sub-element using JAVA_HOME, make sure it is configured correctly for your environment. For example, in your .bashrc file, define JAVA_HOME as follows:\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`\nUse the following steps to modify the build.xml file at the top of the project directory:\n\nSpecify an environment property, named env:\n<property environment=\"env\" />\nIn the target that creates the bundle, specify the location of the JRE on your system, using the env property:\n<runtime dir=\"${env.JAVA_HOME}\" />\nThe resulting build.xml file should look like the following. (The new lines are shown in bold.)\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<project name=\"ButtonDemo\" default=\"default\" basedir=\".\">\n    <import file=\"nbproject/build-impl.xml\"/>\n\n<property environment=\"env\" />\n\n<taskdef name=\"bundleapp\"\n         classname=\"com.oracle.appbundler.AppBundlerTask\"\n         classpath=\"lib/appbundler-1.0ea.jar\" />\n\n<target name=\"bundle-buttonDemo\">\n    <bundleapp outputdirectory=\"dist\"\n        name=\"ButtonDemo\"\n        displayname=\"Button Demo\"\n        identifier=\"components.ButtonDemo\"\n        mainclassname=\"components.ButtonDemo\">\n        <runtime dir=\"${env.JAVA_HOME}\" />\n        <classpath file=\"dist/ButtonDemo.jar\" />\n    </bundleapp>\n</target>\n\n</project>\nCreate a fresh version of ButtonDemo.app, using the ant bundle-buttonDemo command. The resulting version includes the JRE in the app package. You can confirm this by examining the Contents/PlugIns directory inside of the app package.\n\nSign the App\nThe Gatekeeper feature, introduced in Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8), allows users to set the level of security for downloaded applications. By default, Gatekeeper is set to allow only OS X App Store and Developer ID signed applications. Unless your app is signed with a Developer ID certificate provided by Apple, your application will not launch on a system with Gatekeeper's default settings.\n\nFor information on the signing certificates available, see Code Signing Tasks on developer.apple.com.\n\nThe signing certificate contains a field called Common Name. Use the string from the Common Name field to sign your application.\n\nSign your app using the codesign(1) tool, as shown in the following example:\n\n% codesign -s \"Developer ID Application: CommonNameFromCertificate\" ExampleApp.app\nTo verify that the app is signed, the following command provides information about the signing status of the app:\n\n% codesign -d --verbose=4 ExampleApp.app\nTo check whether an application can be launched when Gatekeeper is enabled, use the spctl command:\n\n% spctl --assess --verbose=4 --type execute ExampleApp.app\nIf you leave off the --verbose tag, and it does not print any output, indicates 'success'.\n\nFor more information, see Distributing Outside the Mac App Store on developer.apple.com.\n\nSubmitting an App to the Mac App Store\nPackaging an app for the Mac App Store is similar to packaging for regular distribution up until the step of signing the app. Signing the app for the Mac App Store requires a few more steps, and a different kind of certificate.\n\nYou will need to create an application ID and then obtain a distribution certificate for that application ID. Submit your app using Application Loader. For more information, see the following links (on developer.apple.com):\n\nSubmitting to the Mac App Store\nSubmit Your Application Using Application Loader\nCopyright \u00a9 1993, 2020, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

An installer configuration file is an alternative to, and extension of, options specified on the installer command line.\n\nNote: Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris command-line installers support the configuration file, but not every operating system supports all configuration file options.\n\nThis page has these sections:\n\n\"Using a Configuration File\"\n\n\"Configuration File Options\"\n\n\"Sample Configuration File\"\n\n\"System Runtime Configuration File\"\n\nUsing a Configuration File\nIf you are installing the JRE or JDK on Windows, use the INSTALLCFG command-line option to specify a configuration file:\n\ninstaller INSTALLCFG=configuration_file_path\n\ninstaller is the installer base file name, for example, jre-8u211-windows-x64.exe or jdk-8u211-windows-x64.exe.\n\nconfiguration_file_path is the path to the configuration file.\n\nIf you are installing the JRE or JDK on Solaris, Linux, or macOS, create a configuration file name named /etc/java/config/jre-install.properties. When you launch the JRE or JDK installer, it looks for a configuration file with this specific path and name.\n\nConfiguration File Options\nThe following table lists the installer configuration file options that apply for each operating system.\n\nNote:\n\nYou may substitute the value Enable for 1 and the value Disable for 0.\nYou may use the same options at the command line when running the JDK or JRE Windows Offline Installer.
